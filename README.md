# Multiple_Linear_Regression

Multiple Linear Regression is a statistical method used for modeling the relationship between multiple independent variables (also known as features or predictors) and a dependent variable. It is an extension of simple linear regression, which deals with only one independent variable. In multiple linear regression, the goal is to find the best-fitting linear equation that explains the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable.
